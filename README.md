## 🔧 Requirements

- **Compiler**: MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools) or compatible C compiler
- **Graphics Library**: [raylib 5.5](https://www.raylib.com/)
- **Platform**: Windows (uses Windows-specific file APIs)

## 🚀 Building

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with C++ workload
2. Raylib 5.5 is included in the `libs/` and `includes/` directories

### Compile & Run
```bash
python compile_run.py
```

Or compile manually:

```bash
cl /W4 /WX /Iincludes src/main.c src/fourier.c src/shapes.c libs/raylibdll.lib
main.exe
```

## 📖 Usage

### Drawing Mode
1. Click and drag anywhere on the canvas to draw a shape
2. Release the mouse to start the Fourier animation
3. Watch the epicycles reconstruct your drawing!

### Preset Shapes
- Click any shape button (Circle, Square, Star, etc.) to generate a perfect geometric shape

### Loading Custom Shapes

**From shapes folder:**
- Click "Browse Files..." to see available shapes in the `shapes/` directory

**Drag & Drop:**
- Drag any `.svg` or `.txt` file onto the window from anywhere on your PC

### Controls
| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speed Slider** | Adjust animation speed (0.1x – 5x) |
| **Line Size Slider** | Change trace line thickness |
| **RESTART** | Reset and draw a new shape |

## 📁 Supported File Formats

### TXT Format
Simple coordinate list with one point per line:
```
x1 y1
x2 y2
x3 y3
...
```

Example (`shapes/shape.txt`):
```
0 -100
0 50
-30 50
-30 100
30 100
30 50
```

### SVG Format
Standard SVG files with path elements. Supported path commands:
- `M/m` – Move to
- `L/l` – Line to
- `H/h` – Horizontal line
- `V/v` – Vertical line
- `C/c` – Cubic Bézier curve
- `S/s` – Smooth cubic Bézier
- `Q/q` – Quadratic Bézier curve
- `Z/z` – Close path


## 🎓 How It Works

The **Discrete Fourier Transform** decomposes any signal into a sum of sinusoids at different frequencies. In 2D:

1. **Input**: A series of (x, y) points representing a drawn path
2. **Transform**: Each point is treated as a complex number (x + iy), and DFT computes frequency components
3. **Epicycles**: Each frequency component becomes a rotating circle (epicycle) with:
   - **Radius** = amplitude of the component
   - **Speed** = frequency index
   - **Starting angle** = phase of the component
4. **Reconstruction**: Stacking all rotating circles tip-to-tail traces the original drawing

The more points (N) in your drawing, the more epicycles, and the more accurate the reconstruction.

### The Math

For N sample points, the DFT is:

$$X[k] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \cdot e^{-i2\pi kn/N}$$

Each $X[k]$ gives us an epicycle with:
- Amplitude: $|X[k]|$
- Phase: $\arg(X[k])$
- Frequency: $k$
